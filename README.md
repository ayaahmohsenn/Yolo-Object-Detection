# Yolo-Object-Detection
YOLO v5 | OpenCV 

I downloaded the data from <strong> Kaggle </strong> , converted it into json format using covert_ds_to_json_format.py script where each line in the dataset file contains a JSON object, and loaded it back into the notebook.

Spilitted the data into train and val subsets.

Used OpenCV to format the boundingbox
